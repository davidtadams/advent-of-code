### Setup

Run this to get all the gems
```

run the following to add the rubocop commit hook
```
overcommit --install
```

### Tips for myself

1. When using ruby, you can use [ARGF](https://ruby-doc.org/3.1.3/ARGF.html) to pass the input file in as an argument
    ```
    $ ruby part1.rb input.txt
    ```
